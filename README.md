# Atari-Adventure-Maker
This is one of my projects I have worked on in high school, which is a remake of Atari adventure remade using only
Java's Swift graphics library. There is also a fully featured level editor, which lets you export your levels as files
to share with others, or edit the files directly to make changes. this also includes a premade jar with the required images and sounds, 
however I cannot guarantee that it will run on all systems, so you can also compile the source as well.
